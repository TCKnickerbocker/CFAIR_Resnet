# Residual Neural Network for CFAIR-10 Image Classification
<hr>
This notebook contains an ML project of mine wherein I created, trained, tested, analyzed, and saved a residual neural network model for the CFAIR-10 dataset, a large dataset of 10X10 low-resolution images for classification. The results are discussed in the attatched pdf, as well as within the training and testing notebooks.
